# BF2D
An algorithm to follow/trace boundaries in binary images. Examples with the same shape:
![Example boundary trace, low precision](compl6.png?raw=true "Example boundary trace, low precision")

![Example boundary trace, high precision](compl5.png?raw=true "Example boundary trace, high precision")
